    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <dt>
        <dd>In the final season of Broad City, when negotiating the terms of their relationship, Ilana and Lincoln describe a bowl of pasta in particularly explicit terms. <br>
        As soon as I heard it, I knew I had to make it on the show. Okay yes, this was pretty much just an excuse for me to make some truffle pasta.<br>
        And to use my giant wheel of parmesan for something other than snacking.</dd>

                    <li>8 oz dried bucatini pasta</li>

        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bucatini al Tartufo Method:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the cheese wheel by removing the top and scoping out a ½ inch of cheese to create a shallow bowl. <br>
                        Leave about ½ cup of grated cheese in the ‘bowl’ of the wheel</li>
                    <li>Begin heating a large pot of water with salt over high heat. </li>
                    <li>Combine the butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the butter is foaming, turn off the heat, and grate about half of the truffle into the pan. <br>
                        Let the truffles infuse into the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Cook the fresh pasta in the boiling water for 8-9 minutes, or until al dente.  </li>
                    <li>Add the cooked pasta directly into the large skillet. <br>
                        Toss the pasta in the sauce and add about ¼ cup of pasta water to help emulsify.</li>
                    <li>Add the brandy to a small metal bowl. Ignite the brandy.</li>
                    <li>Very carefully, pour the brandy over the cheese wheel and stir with a large metal spoon to melt the cheese. </li>
                    <li>Add the pasta to the cheese wheel and toss to coat it evenly in the melted cheese.  </li>
                    <li>Season to taste with salt.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately and garnish with more sliced truffles and optionally, truffle pearls.</li>
                </ol>
        </ul>
