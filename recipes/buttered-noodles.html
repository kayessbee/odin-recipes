    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <dt>
            <dd>As seen in the world of Dan Harmon's lovable, irreverent collegiate caricature: Community,<br> 
            I'm here to defend the "weird" favorite food of Abed Nadir: buttered noodles. <br>
            Yes, that impossibly plain side dish/cafeteria filler/thing you eat when you're sick. <br>
            With a few simple tricks, we can upgrade this ubiquitous underdog into something worth making all on its own. </dd>

        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>5 Minute Buttered Noodles Ingredients:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by bringing a pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
                        Add egg noodles and remove from the heat once tender.</li>
                    <li>Drain the noodles and rinse with tap water before adding the noodles back to the pot.<br>
                        Add 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, a pinch of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Mix until the butter has completely melted and the seasoning has mixed evenly across the noodles.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>15 Minute (Better) Buttered Noodles Ingredients:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by bringing an oval-shaped dutch oven of slightly salted water to a boil and then add the high-end pasta.<br>
                        <em>**Use slightly less water to make sure the water is extra starchy.</em></li>
                    <li>Once the pasta is done, put aside about ½ cup of the water and then drain the pasta.<br>
                        Return it to the warm pot and do not rinse.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the unsalted gourmet butter, ¼ cup of the pasta water, and a generous pinch of kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Give it all a rigorous stir until everything is completely dissolved and mixed together. </li>                    
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Butter from Scratch Ingredients:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by combining 4 cups of heavy cream with ½ cup of cultured buttermilk, whisking to combine then covering to let sit out at room temperature for 24 hours. </li>
                    <li>After 24 hours, dump the mixture (which is now creme fraiche) into a stand mixer along with equal parts of room temperature European butter and whip together until all the milk fat separates from the newly minted buttermilk, should only take 15 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Once a butter lump is formed, wash it in ice water 4-5 times until the water squeezed out of the butter runs clear.<br>
                        Squeeze out as much  water as possible then place it in the fridge.</li>                    
                </ol>           
            <li><strong>Homemade Pasta Method:</strong></li>            
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl add 80% double zero flour (12.8 oz), 20% rye flour (3.2 oz), 2 teaspoons of kosher salt, and 3 large eggs. <br>
                        Beat together using a fork and knead for 8-10 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a Ziploc bag or cover with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 30 minutes, cut the dough into smaller pieces then run through a pasta roller 3-4 times.<br>
                        Make sure to fold into thirds after each time through. </li>
                    <li>Once the desired thinness has been reached, run the thin sheet of pasta through a pasta cutter set for fettuccine style pasta. </li>
                    <li>On a well-floured rimmed baking sheet, drape the pasta into small nests and give each nest a nice dusting of flour.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Homemade Buttered Noodles Cooking Method:</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once ready to cook, place the pasta into a large pot of a small amount of boiling water and let it cook for 90 seconds. <br>
                        During the 90 seconds, make sure to keep a saute pan warm, not hot. </li>
                    <li>After 90 seconds, place the cooked pasta into the warm saute pan along with 3 tablespoons of homemade butter, ¼ cup of pasta water, a pinch of kosher salt, and mixing together rigorously. </li>
                    <li>Once the butter sauce has reached an Alfredo-like consistency, place on a plate with a dollop of the creme fraiche, an optional grating of brewers yeast, and enjoy. </li> 
        </ul>
