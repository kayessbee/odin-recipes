    <h1>Ram-don inspired by Parasite</h1>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <dt>
            <dd>Rarely does a dish serve as such a central metaphor for a film's primary conflict: <br>
                in Parasite, boujee beef sits oppressively atop bargain noodles in the Park family's version of Ram-Don, <br>
                the way they sit so literally atop others. It was tricky doing this one without spoilers, but I think I managed!</dd>
        </dt>

        <h3>METHOD</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quick Instant Pack Method</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trim off some of the excess fat from the steak of your choice and cube it into bite-sized pieces. <br>
                        Sear the cubes in a saucepan with hot oil.</li>
                    <li>In some shallow boiling water, place both sets of packaged noodles along with the spicy broth packets and frozen vegetable packets. </li>
                    <li>After about 4 minutes, both the noodles and beef should be finished cooking.<br>
                        Drain all but ⅓  cup of the cooking broth and add the chapagetti’s packet of vegetable oil and bean sauce.<br>
                        Mix to combine, it will turn a muddy brown color. </li>
                    <li>Add the beef to the noodles and stir. Serve and enjoy! </li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Ramen Noodles</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by baking baking soda in a 250℉ oven for 1 hour. <br>
                        Combine 2 tsp of the baked baking soda with 4 ounces plus 1 Tbsp of water. Stir to dissolve completely. </li>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, add 240g all-purpose flour along with the alkaline water mixture you just created. <br>
                        Stir to combine with a large wooden spoon. You want to make a shaggy but cohesive ball of dough. <br>
                        If needed, add a little extra water. </li>
                    <li>Once it’s combined, pat it into a disc, dust it with bread flour, put into a bowl and cover. <br>
                        Let it rest for 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Once it has rested for 30 minutes, remove from bowl and lightly dust it with flour.<br>
                        Roll the dough out and then fold into thirds, and then into thirds again.<br>
                        Attach your pasta attachment to your stand mixer. Remove dough from plastic wrap and dust with bread flour. <br>
                        Give it one pass through on your pasta roller’s widest setting. <br>
                        Fold into thirds, rotate 90° and pass it through again on your pasta press at about 2 or 3. <br>
                        If it seems too long, give it a chop in half. </li>
                    <li>Dust with bread flour again, before passing through your noodle cutter attachment. <br>
                        Add some more bread flour and twist into little nests on a rimmed baking sheet that’s also been dusted with bread flour. </li>                  
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Udon Noodles</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by weighing out 250 grams each of all-purpose flour and bread flour. <br>
                        Add 1 ½ tsp kosher salt to 250 milligrams water. Stir and add to the flour. This gives the dough a hydration of 50%. </li>
                    <li>Mix that around with your fingers until a shaggy ball of dough forms. <br>
                        Turn it out on an unfloured countertop and knead it until semi-smooth but a little lumpy. </li>
                    <li>Place into a heavy duty ziploc bag and squeeze out all of the air before sealing shut. <br>
                        Optionally, you can knead the dough on top of a table with your feet. <br>
                        You can also simply knead with your hands until the dough is flattened into a large disc. <br>
                        Fold into fours, place back into the bag and flatten again. Repeat this 5x. <br>
                        Let rest at room temperature for 1-3 hours. </li>
                    <li>Generously flour the dough and countertop and roll it out using a rolling pin until the dough has reached a thickness of about 3mm.</li>                  
                    <li>For slicing, place the dough on top of itself like an accordion. <br>
                        Make sure not to press down on the folds and that the folds don’t overlap. <br>
                        With a very sharp knife, cut into thin udon noodle sizes.</li>
                    <li>Once cut, unfurl the noodles and dust them with a generous amount of flour (cornstarch or potato starch) and twist them into nests.</li>
                </ol>           
            <li><strong>Korean Dashi</strong></li>            
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pot, pour in 8 cups of water. Add 6 medium pieces of dried kelp and let them soak for 1 hour. <br>
                        Afterwards, add a handful of dried anchovies.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a roaring simmer and hold it there for about 10 minutes before draining and setting aside.  </li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Jjangmyeon</strong></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small saute pan, add 2 Tbsp olive oil, ⅓ cup sweet black bean paste, and 1 Tbsp oyster sauce. <br>
                        Fry together for about 2 minutes and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a large, high-walled saute pan, heat 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until almost smoking. <br>
                        Add 6 ounces of diced pork loin and saute for 2-3 minutes. <br>
                        Add chopped zucchini, chopped yellow onion, and shredded cabbage. </li>
                    <li>Saute together for 2-3 minutes, or until the cabbage is just starting to wilt. <br>
                        Grate in about an inch’s worth of fresh ginger. Add 1 Tbsp mirin and saute for 30 seconds. <br>
                        Add the black bean mixture that you fried earlier. Mix that in until everything is evenly coated, then add in 1 cup of Dashi broth (chicken broth or water work too).</li>
                    <li>Let that mixture gently simmer for 2-3 minutes then thicken everything by adding ¼ cup of water and 1 Tbsp of cornstarch. <br>
                        Mix together, give it a taste, and season to your taste preference with kosher salt. Cover to keep warm. </li>
                    <li>Boil ramen noodles for no more than 3 minutes, checking for doneness after 90 seconds. <br>
                        Put noodles into a bowl and top with jajangmyeon.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><strong>Jjamppong</strong></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. <br>
                            Add 3 Tbsp Korean chili flakes, thinly sliced white bottoms of 4 scallions, an inch of grated ginger, and 2 cloves of grated garlic. </li>
                        <li>Saute this together for 2-3 minutes and then add chopped yellow onion, sliced zucchini, 4 ounces of shredded cabbage,
                            and 4 thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms.  <br>
                            At this time, add the Udon noodles to boiling water since they take 12 minutes to cook.</li>
                        <li>Saute for 2-3 more minutes until everything begins to turn soft. Add 4 cups of dashi broth. <br>
                            Cover and bring to a simmer before adding your seafood of choice. Cover and let simmer. <br>
                            Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                        <li>Take udon noodles out of boiling water when they’re finished and rinse under cold water. <br>
                            Place noodles in a bowl and top with jjamppong.</li>
                        
                    </ol>
